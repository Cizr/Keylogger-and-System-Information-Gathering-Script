## What is a Keylogger?
A keylogger, short for "keystroke logger," is a type of software or hardware designed to capture and record keystrokes made on a computer's keyboard. Initially developed for legitimate purposes like troubleshooting and system monitoring, keyloggers have garnered attention for both their constructive and potentially malicious applications.

## Brief History
The concept of keyloggers can be traced back to the early days of computing, where they were employed to identify and rectify keyboard-related issues. However, as technology progressed, so did the applications of keyloggers. While they remain vital for tasks like system debugging and performance testing, concerns have arisen due to their potential misuse in unauthorized surveillance and cyberattacks.

## The Python Keylogger Script
This Python script is a straightforward implementation of a keylogger created for educational and ethical purposes. It is meant to provide insight into the workings of keyloggers without encouraging malicious use. The script captures keypress events, logs active applications, takes screenshots, and collects system information.

**Important Note**: The script is intended exclusively for educational use. Any misuse for unauthorized access or malicious purposes is strongly discouraged.

## Features
**Keylogging**: Records each keystroke and compiles them into a log file.
**Active Application Logging**: Tracks the names of functional applications with timestamps.
**System Information Gathering**: Collects information about the system, including IP addresses and processor details.
**Screenshot Capture**: Takes snapshots of the screen to visually document user activity.

# Responsible Use
Always use this script responsibly and ethically. Ensure you have explicit consent before running it on any system, and be aware of the legal implications surrounding the use of such tools. Respect the privacy and security of individuals, and avoid any activities that may violate laws or ethical standards.
